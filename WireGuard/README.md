#### by [Jason A. Donenfeld](mailto:Jason@zx2c4.com) of [Edge Security](https://www.edgesecurity.com/)

**[PQ-Enhanced]** by [Malloc](https://www.mallocprivacy.com) with quantum-resistant cryptography

WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and utilizes **state-of-the-art cryptography**. 

**[PQ-Enhanced]** Now with hybrid post-quantum Kyber1024/X25519 handshakes and AVX2-optimized lattice operations.

It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache.  It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN,  **[PQ-Enhanced]** while remaining quantum-resistant. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. It runs over UDP.
